# Changelog

## 0.3.0-relayout.4

- **历史补全：改为实验性、默认关闭**（工具栏「补全首轮（实验）」）。原因：历史窗口按**消息条数**计，而轮次长度可变，所以任何固定页数都无法稳定补全一轮——一页会切掉长轮次、又会越过短轮次。现在开启时只多取一页，并在控制台打印一次诊断（最上面那轮的节点类型、`location` 字段名、已加载步数、过程记录），用于把这个功能做对；关闭时完全按窗口原样显示。

- **The steps pill stays away for a truncated turn**: the history window cuts into
  older turns, so their step count is a partial sum while the process record reports the
  absolute step the answer landed on. The two are not comparable, and rather than show a
  number with a caveat the pill renders nothing for those turns — the same treatment the
  usage/duration pills already get. Complete turns are unchanged.

- **Steps pill in the answer's action row**: between the usage/duration pills and the
  closing clock, a `N/M 个步骤` pill opens the turn's process record rendered in
  Chinese — the answer's step and the turn's total steps, what came before the answer
  (messages, tool calls, subagents, whether thinking sat inline), and the process
  start/answer anchor event numbers.

## 0.3.0-relayout.3

Relayout fork of [`aa2246740/dsh-better-display`](https://github.com/aa2246740/dsh-better-display) (MIT).

- **Short thinking is framed too**: dropped the rule that removed the border/background for a non-overflowing transcript; the box still sizes to its content and has no fold/expand control.
- **Frame padding** for the short-reasoning card: heading `10px 16px 0`, text `8px 16px 16px`, matching long reasoning.
- **Wheel handoff from the reasoning area**: once the transcript reaches the edge it is being pushed against, the wheel scrolls the conversation; a short transcript never intercepts the wheel.
- **Every user/context message renders above the process disclosure**: a turn may open with a system prompt and carry several user/steering messages; they now all render before the disclosure, so turns read `用户的话 → 用时（可点击）→ 思考/回答` with or without a system prompt.
- Unchanged from upstream: turn child order, the elapsed-time pill in the answer's action row, and the disclosure label's `用时 X 秒` text.
- **Installs under its own name**: `cordis.patch.yml` resolved its loader row to upstream's package name, which this profile no longer installs, so the Host refused to boot (`Cannot find package 'dsh-better-display' imported from …/profiles/web/`). The row now resolves `dsh-better-display-reforged`.
- **Boots under the fork's own package name**: the client bundle still registered itself as `dsh-better-display`, while the Host derives the client row id from the installed manifest (`dsh-better-display-reforged`) and refuses a bundle that registers anything else — DeepSeek Harness 0.1.5-rc.1/rc.2 failed the whole page with `bundle … loaded without registering "dsh-better-display-reforged" via __ModuleLoader__.load`. The bundle (and its CSS-ownership tags, which HMR matches by plugin id) now carry the package name; `tsdown.config.ts` reads it from `package.json` so a rebuild cannot drift again.

## Upstream releases

Stock DeepSeek Harness install: `dsh plugin --profile web add github:aa2246740/dsh-better-display`, then restart that Host and reload. Ships `dsh.bundle.patch` → `cordis.patch.yml` and committed `lib/`. No `prepare`.

### 0.2.1

- **Rail jump no longer lifts the composer**: the right-hand turn rail lands on `[data-conversation-scroll]` the same way official ChatView does. `scrollIntoView` was also scrolling ancestor boxes, so jumping to the top of history and then back to the latest turn left the sticky input card stranded up the column.

## 0.2.0

Adds native generative MCP Apps (SEP-1865) support and rich interactive rendering.

- **Generative MCP Apps**: auto-detect ````mcp-app` code blocks (or `mcp-app` custom blocks / `render_ui`/`show_widget` tool results) and mount them as live, interactive cards.
- **Sandboxed iframe**: `sandbox="allow-scripts allow-forms"` without `allow-same-origin`, `referrerPolicy="no-referrer"` — full isolation from host cookies/tokens/DOM.
- **SEP-1865 JSON-RPC bridge**: `ui/initialize`, `ui/resize`, `ui/submit` / `ui/update-model-context`, plus live `host-context-changed` theme broadcasts.
- **Bidirectional feedback**: user interactions produce a natural-language prompt written straight into the composer via React 18 native setter (instant, no stale-DOM whitespace).
- **Live dark/light sync**: MutationObserver + matchMedia drive instant re-theming with zero first-frame flash.
- **Pixel-perfect auto height**: content-bottom bounding-box measurement + ResizeObserver; 60px–2400px smooth grow/shrink, no double scrollbars or wasted whitespace.
- **Redesigned minimal container**: removed protocol/status chrome, 14px-radius subtle card, icon-only reset.
- **Skill pack**: `skills/generative-mcpapps/` with SKILL.md, protocol reference, HTML boilerplate template, and interactive quiz example.
- **Docs**: bilingual `README.md` / `README.en.md`; DESIGN.md contract updated.
- 49 regression tests.
